Like others, we see the recent rise in obesity as the result of past decades of societal, technical and ideological change. The pace and scale of change may only now be gaining attention, but the evidence has been strong for decades (1). Part of the search for solutions must be the investigation of not just what the drivers of obesity over time have been but how they interact. Too many analyses of obesity are locked into disciplinary boxes when, given the complexity and breadth of such drivers, it is likely that obesity requires a broader interdisciplinary analysis and a sustained, society-wide response. By implication, quick fixes or single-factor remedies are unlikely to work.On a positive note, political processes are beginning to emerge giving due priority to the obesity crisis. In the UK, after a National Audit Office report and the Chief Medical Officers clarion call about obesity being a timebomb, the issue climbed up the national policy agenda (2,3). A Par- liamentary Inquiry spelled out the complexity of the issues and gave suggestions for direction of travel (4). All the devolved governments of the UK now have commitments to tackle obesity. However, even the briefest review of recent trends shows the scale of difficulties.In Scotland, childhood obesity is rising rapidly, with levels of overweight and obesity among younger and older children at double the levels that might have been expected on the basis of data for the UK as a whole (5). Currently in Scotland, 26% of women and 22% of men have a body mass index (BMI) of > 30 and 65% of men and 60% of women have a BMI of >25 (6). Data from the Scottish Health Survey 2003 reported that people living in the most deprived areas were more likely than those in the least deprived areas to be obese or morbidly obese, and morbid obesity was three times higher among women in the lowest- income households than in the highest.In England, the 1992 Health of the Nation, the English national strategy for public health, introduced a target to reduce the proportion of obese men aged 16–64 in the population from 7% in 1986–1987 to 6% in 2005, and obese women from 12% in 1986–1987 to 8% in 2005. A 1996 review of the Health of the Nation by the National Audit Office showed that by 1993, the proportions of obese men and women in the population had risen to 13% and 16% (7). By 2003, 22% of men and 23% of women were obese (8) and by 2010, on these trends, obesity will rise to 33% of men and 28% of women. Childhood obesity in 2– 10-year-olds has risen from 9.9% in 1995 to 14.3% in 2004. On current trends, 20% of 2–10-year-olds – more than 1 million children – will be obese by 2010.
